BetterChairs allows you and your players to sit on chairs. It's that simple!
Every stair and every half block can be a chair if you want it to!

It is:
* **fast**, as it has been written with performance in mind
* **easily updated**, because you get notified about new versions, and your configurations get upgraded
* **customizable**, as it generates configuration files for you
* **reliable**, as it supports all Minecraft versions newer than 1.8 natively
* **free** and OpenSource. Request Features or add them yourself!

## Why did you create *BetterChairs (Remastered)*?
BetterChairs started in 2016 on SpigotMC and has been developed by
[BlackScarx](https://github.com/BlackScarx). Some years later,
I made my first commits to the project by adding custom Spigot-Events I wanted to use.

I have been granted write-access to that repository afterwards but could not contact
BlackScarx and created this fork to fit my need and provide support for new Minecraft version.

My fork quickly made some big changes, and decided to fully recode and redesign this project.
I started with moving to Maven and deleting all those `spigot.jar`s from the repository.

Because of that I rewrote the commit history and detached my Fork on GitHub to be no longer displayed as one
(always said *'29 commits behind'* because the commit hashes changed).

Today, I unofficially took over the project as soon as BlackScarx got inactive and maintain this repository.
